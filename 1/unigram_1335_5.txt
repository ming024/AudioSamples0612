It stands for all that roast turkey does in this country. At weddings feasts and holidays, it is the chief dish. Among the hindustani christians, it is the christmas dinner. Sometimes it is served with rivers of hot curry flowing over it, but often it is eaten without the curry. In india it is usually made with chicken but any kind of meat does nicely.
