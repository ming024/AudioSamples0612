New alarm arose within me for this new sight suggested something more terrible than anything that i had thus far thought of. This then i thought was to be the end of my voyage. This was my goal, a pit of fire into which i should be hurled. Would it be well i thought, to wait for such a fate and experience such a death agony? Would it not be better for me to take my own life before i should know the worst? I took my pistol and loaded it so as to be prepared, but hesitated to use it until my fate should be more apparent. So i sat, holding my pistol prepared to use it watching the light, and awaiting the time when the glowing fires should make all further hope impossible.
