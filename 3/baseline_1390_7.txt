The outpourings of a tenderness reawakened by remorse.
The pageantry of sea and sky.
The palest abstractions of thought.
The palpitating silence lengthened.
The panorama of life was unrolled before him.
The paraphernalia of power and prosperity.
The parting crimson glory of the ripening summer sun.
The past slowly drifted out of his thought.
The pendulous eyelids of old age.
