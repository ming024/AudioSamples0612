Struck dumb with strange surprise,
Stung by his thoughts and impatient of rest,
Stung by the splendor of the prospect,
Subdued passages of unobtrusive majesty,
Sublime indifference to contemporary usage and taste,
Submission to an implied rebuke,
Subtle indications of great mental agitation, subtle suggestions of remoteness,
Such things as the eye of history sees,
Such was the petty chronicle,
Suddenly a thought shook him,
Suddenly overawed by a strange delicious shyness,
Suddenly smitten with unreality,
Suddenly snuffed out in the middle of ambitious schemes,
Suffered to languish in obscurity,
Sugared remonstrances and cajoleries,
Suggestions of veiled and vibrant feeling,
Summer clouds floating feathery overhead,
