There being no competition. No time or space is required for sensational trash. Thus if nothing of importance occurs, nothing need be transmitted. The official news censors decide as to the relative importance of occurrences. There need not be a certain amount of news telegraphed each hour. The government verifies as much as possible all reports before they are transmitted. There are indeed some advantages in the government being in constant touch with each home under its care. The advertising department pays nearly all expenses of this whole system of journalism. Announcements for private gain are paid at a regular rate.
