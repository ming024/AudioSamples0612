Don't let this go any further, certainly not. I shouldn't like her to know that she nearly let me in for a very bad bargain. No sooner did i sign the agreement than she got engaged, poor little girl. She was so keen on it all and wouldn't even wait to make proper inquiries about the shooting, afraid it would get snapped up just like all of your sex. Well no harm's done. She has had her country wedding and i've got rid of my house to some fellows who are starting a preparatory school. Where shall we live then henry? I should enjoy living somewhere. I have not yet decided.
