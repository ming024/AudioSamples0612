In a considerable town two persons dwelt in adjoining houses, one of them conceived such a violent hatred against the other, that the hated party resolved to remove to a distance being persuaded that their being neighbours was the only cause of this animosity. For though he had done him several pieces of service, he found that his hatred was not diminished. He therefore sold his house with what goods he had left and retired to the capital city of a kingdom which was not far distant. Here he bought a little spot of ground which lay about half a league from the city where he had a convenient house with a garden and a pretty spacious court, wherein there was a deep well which was not in use.
