It was early evening of a day in the late fall and the winesburg county fair had brought crowds of country people into town. The day had been clear and the night came on warm and pleasant, on the trunion pike where the road after it left town stretched away between berry fields now covered with dry brown leaves. The dust from passing wagons arose in clouds. Children curled into little balls slept on the straw scattered on wagon beds. Their hair was full of dust and their fingers black and sticky. The dust rolled away over the fields and the departing sun set it ablaze with colors.
