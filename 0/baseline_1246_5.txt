"I can climb if i have to," retorted johnny chuck indignantly, "I've climbed up bushes and low trees lots of times, and if i can get a good run first, I can climb up the straight trunk of a tree with rough bark to the first branches if they are not too far above ground. You ask reddy fox if I can't he knows"

"He certainly is all right as a digger," exclaimed peter rabbit.
