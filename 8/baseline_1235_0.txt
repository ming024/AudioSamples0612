The story of the first old man and the hind. I shall begin my story then listen to me i pray you with attention. This hind you see is my cousin, nay, what is more my wife. She was only twelve years of age when i married her, so that i may justly say she ought to regard me equally as her father her kinsman and her husband. We lived together twenty years without any children, her barrenness did not effect any change in my love. I still treated her with much kindness and affection. My desire of having children only induced me to purchase a slave by whom i had a son, who was extremely promising. My wife being jealous cherished a hatred for both mother and child, but concealed her aversion so well that i knew nothing of it till it was too late.
