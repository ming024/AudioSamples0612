Blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he hath been approved, he shall receive a crown of life which the lord promised to them that love him. Let no man say when he is tempted, i am tempted of god. For god cannot be tempted with evil and he himself tempteth, no man but each man is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust and enticed.
