Checks or drafts received by you should be deposited as soon as possible. Should you receive a check for a considerable amount, and have no convenient bank account. You should go to the bank on which the check is drawn, and have the cashier certify it by stamping accepted or certified across the face over his signature. That formality makes the paper as good as money so long as the bank accepting it is solvent. It sometimes happens that a check drawn in good faith by a responsible party is withheld so long by the person receiving it that there is no money to the account when the check is finally presented.
