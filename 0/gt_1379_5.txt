Alien paths and irrelevant junketings.
All embrowned and mossed with age. 
All her gift of serene immobility brought into play. 
All hope of discreet reticence was ripped to shreds. 
All the lesser lights paled into insignificance. 
All the magic of youth and joy of life was there. 
All the place is peopled with sweet airs. 
All the sky was mother of pearl and tender. 
All the unknown of the night and of the universe was pressing upon him.
